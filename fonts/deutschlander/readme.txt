Hi everyone, and thanks for having a look. Tall, dark, and handsome Deutschlander will provide you with a clean typeface to insert when space is limited. The vertical nature of this extra condensed sans serif adds real estate to your subtitles and logos. Add Deutchlander to the bottom of a movie 
poster for credits, advertising projects, or anywhere you have a need for display typography. Basic latin, extended latin, European accents, and punctuation are included. Additional characters, marks, and other languages, may be added for a fee so contact me if you're interested. There are two
stylistic sets, alternate characters, fractions, and kerning available using the OTF features. The italic version is included with purchase of commercial license. 

This font like my others are free for personal use only as long as this readme file stays intact. For commercial use please contact me at dennis@sharkshock.net to discuss an end user license agreement. You can also visit www.sharkshock.net/license for more info. I also design custom fonts for
businesses, logos, and many other things. If you'd like to leave me a PayPal donation you can use my email address above. Your generosity will be most appreciated!
